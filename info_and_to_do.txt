**TO DO: TASKs, GOALs and IDEAs (Then write these on readme)**
1. Create a list with variables:
    1. Gender: Gender of the student (male/female)
    2. EthnicGroup: Ethnic group of the student (group A to E)
    3. ParentEduc: Parent(s) education background (from some_highschool to master's degree)
    4. LunchType: School lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
    5. TestPrep: Test preparation course followed (completed or none)
    6. ParentMaritalStatus: Parent(s) marital status (married/single/widowed/divorced)
    7. PracticeSport: How often the student parctice sport (never/sometimes/regularly)
    8. IsFirstChild: If the child is first child in the family or not (yes/no)
    9. NrSiblings: Number of siblings the student has (0 to 7)
    10. TransportMeans: Means of transport to school (schoolbus/private)
    11. WklyStudyHours: Weekly self-study hours(less that 5hrs; between 5 and 10hrs; more than 10hrs)
    12. MathScore: math test score(0-100)
    13. ReadingScore: reading test score(0-100)
    14. WritingScore: writing test score(0-100)



2. Delete first columnn which is used to indicate index, it's not needed as we have the index when we use pandas dataframe
3.  Filling null values: 
    1. There are some columnns with null values, such as (May be I can  make some forecasts to fill these ?): 
        - EthnicGroup: fill with a new value "not indicated" as it is a private value. 
        - ParentEduc: regression? may be I can guess based on income?
        - TestPrep: filling based on scores?
        - ParentMaritalStatus: 
        - PracticeSport: see the correlation and decide ?
        - IsFirstChild
        - NrSiblings
        - TransportMeans: most common?
        - WklyStudyHours: based on scores? 
4. Find the grade point avarage for each student
5. Find the average for each subject
6. Do some plots dividingthe students based on:
    1. Gender
    2. Parent education
    3. ... and other variables to see the correlation (may be calculate averages for each point)
7. Changing column names for an easier control ?
